## Setup Instructions

1. **Download the Models**
   After downloading the models, extract and place them in the folder `balls-detection/models`.

2. **Download the Video Sample**
   After downloading the video sample, place it in the folder `balls-detection/videos`.

## Running the Project

1. Ensure that the necessary models are placed in the correct folder: `balls-detection/models`.
2. Make sure the video sample is placed in the `balls-detection/videos` folder.
3. Run the detection script, and the model will process the video and detect balls.
